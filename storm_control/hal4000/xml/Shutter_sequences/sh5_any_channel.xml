<!-- Oversampling : Oversampling is only useful if you want to use shutter sequences that 
    have fraction on/off values. For example you want to turn the laser on in the middle of
     a frame, or maybe only have the laser on for the first 1/100th of a frame.
	-->
<!-- by_name : True means you can refer to channels by wavelength value instead of 
    channel number.
